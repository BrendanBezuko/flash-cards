# Local Flash Card Game

A simple flash card application that runs locally without a backend using indexedDB. The reason i created this was becasue I was curious about indexedDB and wanted to make a simple local flashcard application. Here it is

## Todo:

- Interface improvements

## Features coming soon:

- Easily export the database - just incase you loss your data (ike clear your browser history) you'll have a back up.
- Implement a way to handle various decks of cards for different topics

## Nice to have features:

- Better image handling - Right now I'm just down scaling the images and storing as blobs, it would be better to have some compression.
- Analytics. Using chartJS it would be nice to add some analytics and stats to keep track of your progress with different decks

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
